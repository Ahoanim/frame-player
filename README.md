#Frame Player

A video player without video files, just JSON. Based on "images frames" thought to mobile devices!

#The Problem
The problem of today's HTML5 video is that it can't be played in-line on an HTML page on mobile devices. The way the handheld devices handle it is they open the video in a native player which takes over the page itself, making it impossible to implement any interaction while the video is playing. Also, you can't play two videos at the same time.

#The Solution
Create a player instead of playing video files, show a sequence of images at a certain rate.


#Usage

- Insert this HTML code on any part of your page and set the data-src attribute for your JSON video file

```html
	<div id="my-player" data-vidsrc="videos/video.json"></div>
```

- Put the script on your page

```html
	<script src="src/js/frameplayer.js"></script>
```

- Set the options

```javascript
var options = ({
    'rate': 30,
    'controls': false,
    'autoplay': true,
    'width': '640px',
    'height': '390px',
    // 'radius': '50%'
});
```

- Init the player

```javascript
var player = new FramePlayer();
player.load('my-player', options);
player.play();
```

- You also can use **bower** to install frame-player

```bash
bower install frame-player
```

#Generating the JSON Video File

- Use ffmpeg to generate the frames from a video file:

```bash
ffmpeg -i video.mp4 -an -f image2 "%d.jpg"
```

- Convert all frames on a single JSON file

	- Option 1: Node.js

		```bash
		cd converter
		node app.js frameStart frameEnd folder/to/imgs/ json/video.json
		```

	- Option 2: PHP

		```bash
		php to_data_uri.php frameStart frameEnd folder/to/imgs/ json/video.json
		```
